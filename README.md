# Getting-Started

Hello,

    Thank you for dropping by! 
    This repo will be where my thoughts will rest. I have several items I want to make but i'm unsure where to start.
    I'm not a programmer, I'm learning to write Linux Bash Scripts. So please feel free to throw suggestions and edits and comments to       anything that I post here. 
    
    I'm going to be posting my scripts as I think of them if you see a way to clean it up please let me know and please explain why that     works better. 
    
    
          I'll update this again later
          
          
          
          
                  Thanks Jason
