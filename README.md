# Getting-Started

Hello,

Thank you for dropping by! 
This repo will be where my thoughts will rest. I have several items I want to make but i'm unsure where to start.
I'm not a programmer, I'm learning to write Linux Bash Scripts. I am also learning to write Python scripts. I will be placing my scripts and programs here. So please feel free to throw suggestions and edits and comments to anything that I post here. 
    
If you see a way to clean anything up please let me know and please explain why that works better. 
    
    
I'll update this again later

Thanks,
Jason
